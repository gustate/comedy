# [Gus Tate | Comedian](http://www.gustatecomedy.com/)

This is my comedy website, created for bookers and promoters who need to copy my bio, download some headshots, or see a video before they book me. I built it from a [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) template called [Agency](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/). The theme itself is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).
